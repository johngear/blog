This is a new personal website I made with Hugo and Netlify. This repo directly connects and is live-updated to johngearig.com via Netlify, which I think is pretty cool!

In the past, I made a website with AWS, but pushing updates added a lot of friction. Now I can write and push a change in minutes via Github.

I wrote a little more here-- https://johngearig.com/posts/website/
