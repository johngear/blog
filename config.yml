        Title: Hey, I'm John.
        Content: >
                I recently made [Philosophy Chat](https://philosophy-chat.com/). I’m a recently graduated computer engineer with a masters degree in philosophy,  who’s on the job market. I spent 5 years at Michigan studying electrical and computer engineering with a focus in machine learning and semiconductors. I recently returned from a funded fellowship at the London School of Economics, where I studied philosophy of science, specializing in the implications of artificial intelligence. 
                
                Now, I’m looking for a role in Software Engineering, Machine Learning or data science, ideally with a focus on AI alignment, safety or computer vision. You can learn more about my background [here](/about) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-gearig/). You can reach me at jckgearig AT gmail dot com. Say hi if you think there’s a good fit or just want to talk.
