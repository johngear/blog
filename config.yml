        Title: Hey, I'm John.
        Content: >
                I’m a recently graduated computer engineer and lover-of-philosophy who’s on the job market. I spent 5 years at Michigan studying electrical and computer engineering with a focus in machine learning and semiconductors. I recently returned from a funded fellowship in London, where I studied philosophy of science, thinking about the implications of AI.

                Now, I’m looking for a role in Software Engineering, Machine Learning or data (ideally with focusing on AI alignment, safety or computer vision). You can learn more about my background [here](/about) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-gearig/). You can reach me at jckgearig AT gmail dot com. Say hi if you think there’s a good fit or just want to talk.
