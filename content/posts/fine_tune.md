<!-- # Hacking together a Philosophy Q&A Application! -->

Over the last month and a half, I've been working on a Q&A application for academic philosophy questions. I'm working on making a longer post, but check out the [Github](https://github.com/johngear/Encyclopedia-GPT) for a longer description and technical details. 

More than just giving an accurate answer, the program provides the sections of text that it references and links, so the scholar can ensure accuracy and study further. 


Once I've deployed the web application and improved the runtime a bit, I'll post a link.

Here's what it looks like!
