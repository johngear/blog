# Meaning of Life
There seems to be a large language dependency on this question. Here's different ways you could try to tease out the same bottom line
* What's the meaning of life?
* What gives life the most meaning?
* What is the best life to live?
* What is the best meaning to give your life?
* What things should you optimize for to give you the best life?
* What's it all about?
* ...

I don't wish to become a philosopher of language, so I will avoid the hard problem of differentiating how these answers may differ. I like to be agnostic about whether or not there is a *real* meaning to life, when there can just be the meaning that we find. Whether or not this is mind dependent isn't my concern. I will take as a huge implicit assumption that if there is a real meaning, it would converge with the best meaning that we can independently strive for. As in, as humans converge on what the meaning of life is successfully, then we will converge on what the actual meaning of life is.

So, here's two formulations of the question that I like best, and my answers.

Question: What's it all about? 
Answer: Love

Question: What's the meaning of life? 
Answer: To give life meaning.

Life is inherently finite. One of the many experiences that unifies all humans (and likely other living things) is our placement in the present (see ***PRESENTISM***). Time is perpetually passing us by and nothing can be done to stop this. While knowledge of the physics of relativity shows us that time passes relative to our inertial reference frame, the person experiencing the passing of time will never have their experience augmented. Sure-- we can concoct thought experiments where two people who start at the same age, end up at different ages due to some near-speed-of-light travel. But assuming that one sentient experience can only be at one inertial reference frame (which would be fun to tease out a case where this didn't hold), every experience experiencing entity will always pass through time, falling thought it at a constant rate. 

So, it's primitive and basic to say, but a meaning of life has to take the passage of time as a central feature, because it seems to be a central feature of life. 

The meaning of life is to love and be loved. To savor experiences that are fleeting by definition. To feel an extreme range of emotions and mind states-- pleasure, hate, love, pride, tranquility...-- and converge on feeling the emotions that enrich the experience the most. Hedonists get a bad reputation, but I think they're mostly right in this regard. At minimum, their framework seems to be able to successfully account for a variety of seemingly equally good outcomes. Hedonists should be hedonists on an average that ranges in the ~year, ~decade though. Optimizing for feelings of the pleasure in the short term seems to lead to bad long term pleasure. Whereas, optimizing for pleasure over 10 years seems to avoid most of the criticism that can be waged towards hedonists. 

Love:

There is deep magic in finding oneself in part of a social arrangment. I like to imagine these all as graphs, as is popular in software and whatnot. I think there is deep intrinsic value in the existence of nodes of social graphs, that model/are/represent relationships.
