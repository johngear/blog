    <pre>
  [Intro]
  G     D     Am    C
  
  [Verse 1]
  G                   D
  I remember all them summers
  Am                      C
  Playing till my fingers bled
  G                   D
  You'd sing the songs and I'd sing with you
  Am                      C
  We'd get drunk and go to bed
  G                   D
  Looking back at all them memories
  Am                      C
  Lord I hate to sleep alone
  G                   D
  But if you ever get the notion
  Am                      C
  That you need me let me know
  
  [Chorus]
  G
  Cause it's just 2 hours to get there, babe
  D
  I can make it back about an hour or so
  Am
  Hold you close against my skin
  C
  I need a little warmth on a night so cold
  G
  Singing songs you used to sing
  D
  The one about the lady in the long black veil
  Am
  Should have seen the warnings signs
  C
  But Lord I love to hear you wail
  G
  High and lonesome, hard and strong
  D
  Even if it was a little out of tune
  Am
  Hotter than socks on a Jersey giant
  C
  Lord I thought you hung the moon
  
  [Interlude]
  G     D     Am    C
  
  [Verse 2]
  G                   D
  I remember all them winters
  Am                       C
  Drinking Woodford till we drowned
  G                      D
  We'd get wind about a party
  Am                      C
  Bundle up and go to town
  G                    D
  Never worry 'bout the police
  Am                      C
  Never worried much at all
  G                   D
  I miss those nights of reckless glory
  Am                      C
  I'd come back if you'd just call
  
  [Chorus]
  G
  Cause it's just 2 hours to get there, babe
  D
  I can make it back about an hour or so
  Am
  Hold you close against my skin
  C
  I need a little warmth on a night so cold
  G
  Singing songs you used to sing
  D
  The one about the lady in the long black veil
  Am
  Should have seen the warnings signs
  C
  But Lord I love to hear you wail
  G
  High and lonesome, hard and strong
  D
  Even if it was a little out of tune
  Am
  Hotter than socks on a Jersey giant
  C
  Lord I thought you hung the moon
  
  [Interlude]
  G     D     Am    C
  
  [Bridge]
  Am                       C
  I left town when we were over
  Am                       C
  Cause it didn't feel the same
  Am                     C
  Every backroad had a memory
  Am                     D    D7
  Every memory held your name

  [Verse 1]
           C               G              Am
  Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
  F                        C    G
    If'n you don't know by now
         C               G              Am
  An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
  D7                    G    G7
     It'll never do somehow
            C                    C7
  When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
  F                         D7
   Look out your window and I'll be gone
  C          G            Am           F
  You're the reason I'm a-trav'lin' on
      C           G               C
  But don't think twice, it's all right
  
  C  G  Am  F  C
  
  [Verse 2]
         C                 G               Am
  And it ain't no use in a-turnin' on your light, babe
      F             C      G
  The light I never knowed
         C               G               Am
  An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
  D7                            G      G7
    I'm on the dark side of the road
        C                                 C7
  But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
     F                         D7
  To try and make me change my mind and stay
  C        G            Am             F
  We never did too much talkin' anyway
  C            G              C
  Don't think twice, it's all right
  
  C  G  Am  F  C
  
  [Verse 3]
         C               G              Am
  No, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
  F                            C    G
    Like you never done before
         C               G              Am
  And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
  D7                          G    G7
     I can't hear you anymore
        C                        C7
  I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
    F                     D7
  I once loved a woman, a child I am told
    C           G             Am            F
  I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
  C           G                  C
  Don't think twice, it's all right
  
  C  G  Am  F  C
  
  [Verse 4]
     C   G            Am
  So loooooong, honey babe
            F              C    G
  Where I'm bound, I can't tell
      C         G          Am
  But goodbye's too good a word, babe
  D7                            G     G7
    So I'll just say fare thee well
  C                          C7
  I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
      F                         D7
  You could have done better but I don't mind
  C              G        Am         F
  You just kinda wasted my precious time
  C           G               C
  Don't think twice, it's all right

    <pre>
  [Intro]
  A     A     A     A
  
  [Verse 1]
  A       A           Bm     Bm
  I lit a thin green candle
  D           D         A   A
  to make you jealous of me
           A               A           Bm      Bm
  but the room just filled up with mosquitoes
        D             D        E    E
  they heard that my body was free
        F#m        F#m       C#m            C#m
  Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night
         D         D            A   A
  and I put it in your little shoe
       Bm        Bm          G             G
  and then I confess that I tortured the dress
            Bm           A             G       G
  that you wore for the world to look through
  
  [Break]
  A     A     A     A
  
  [Verse 2]
  A          A            Bm     Bm
  I showed my heart to the doctor
  D           D            A    A
  he said I'd just have to quit
       A            A          Bm       Bm
  then he wrote himself a perscription
       D             D           E   E
  and your name was mentioned in it
        F#m          F#m       C#m     C#m
  Then he locked himself in a library shelf
            D          D        A    A
  with the details of our honeymoon
         Bm            Bm
  and I hear from the nurse
             G           G
  that he's gotten much worse
           Bm          A        G    G
  and his practice is all in a ruin
  
  [Break]
  A     A     A     A
  
  [Verse 3]
  A            A             Bm        Bm
  I heard of a saint who had loved you
        D           D            A      A
  So I studied all night in his school
      A               A       Bm     Bm
  he taught that the duty of lovers
         D           D      E    E
  is to tarnish the golden rule
            F#m        F#m
  And just when I was sure
            C#m            C#m
  that his teachings were pure
      D          D           A    A
  he drowned himself in the pool
       Bm      Bm            G           G
  his body is gone but back here on the lawn
       Bm       A          G     G
  his spirit continues to drool
  
  [Break]
  A     A     A     A
  
  [Verse 4]
  A      A           Bm    Bm
  An Eskimo showed me a movie
        D        D        A   A
  he'd recently taken of you
       A              A           Bm        Bm
  the poor man could hardly stop shivering,
       D            D            E    E
  his lips and his fingers were blue
       F#m           F#m
  I suppose that he froze
            C#m            C#m
  when the wind took your clothes
         D             D         A    A
  and I guess he just never got warm
           Bm             Bm           G           G
  but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice
              Bm          A        G     G
  oh, please let me come into the storm
  
  [Outro]
